gate should be an interface - other gates should implement gate

how to resize a gate (?)
	select qubits e.g. 1 and 3 in |xyz>
	make new basis e.g. |xz>
	convert each new basis to column vectors
	take the product of the fundamental matrix and each column vector
	this gives us a new set of column vectors
	convert each column vector to basis vectors |ab>
	replace the xs and zs with a and b respectivey
	convert resulting basis to matrix the size of the register

get the product of the matrix and the register
should empty positions be the identity matrix instead of a matrix of all zeros?
num_steps and object are in different order in different classes
